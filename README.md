# Welcome to the Coq Universe Project!

## Introduction and Goals

Coq Universe aims to provide a composed build of all active Coq
projects that is a starting point for:

- large-scale refactoring and tooling
- proof mining and exploration
- incremental testing
- uniform and easy building of Coq projects

Coq Universe takes inspiration from the (Dune
Universe)[https://github.com/dune-universe/dune-universe] and
(opam-monorepo)[https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-monorepo], the (Dune
build system)[https://github.com/ocaml/dune], and Isabelle's (Archive
of Formal Proofs)[https://www.isa-afp.org/].

Coq Universe is developed by Ali Caglayan, Emilio J. Gallego Arias,
and Thomas Binetruy-Pic.

## Components

Coq Universe is built using Dune, and for now, aims to include
projects present in Coq's CI system

### Submission to Coq Universe

For now we require that participating projects use Dune and are
already present in Coq's CI.

## Community and Code of Conduct

Code of Conduct will be added soon. This is a community project.
